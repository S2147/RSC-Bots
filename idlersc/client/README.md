# Client

This code is part of the Open RSC desktop client, and is copied over from
the [core][0] repository when changes have been made upstream. There are two
distinct folders that contain the client code:

* [`Client_Base`][1]
* [`PC_Client`][2]

For convenience, to update the client code, a script is available in the
primary folder of this repository. It can be invoked using
`make update-client`.
